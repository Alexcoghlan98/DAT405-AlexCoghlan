For this assignment, we were asked to develop and create a
data visualisation that would grab information from a website and display it
to a user. It would also need to change its visual condition overtime,
or if the program changes according to the user interactions
such as keyboard or mouse events.

When the webpage is first displayed to the user it will show one of the cities
that i have used in my project. it will display the name of the random city
and under this it will say the current temperature of that city and the
humidity percentage of that city. It will also display a specific colour that
will correspond with the current weather condition of that city.
For example, if the weather was really warm it will display a bright red as the
background colour. Then if the weather was cold then it would show a blue
background. If the user wanted to have a different city displayed to them then
they will need to simply click on the page and it will display a different city
to them.
